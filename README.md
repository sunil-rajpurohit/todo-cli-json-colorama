# 📝 To-Do CLI App with JSON, Colorama & Timestamps

A beginner-friendly yet feature-rich **Python CLI To-Do List App** built as part of my #50DaysOfPython challenge (Day 2). It supports colored output in the terminal, timestamped tasks, and stores data persistently in a JSON file.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Add new tasks with timestamps
- 🗂️ View all tasks (completed/pending)
- 🟢 Mark tasks as complete
- 🧠 Colored CLI output using `colorama`
- 💾 Save and load tasks using `JSON`
- ⏳ Timestamp support for every task added

---

## 🛠️ Modules Used

- `colorama` – for colored terminal output  
- `json` – for storing and reading data  
- `datetime` – for timestamps  
- `os` – for checking if data file exists
